# color-segment
This code will segment the image into 'k' number of clusters of the most dominant colors. Look at image below. <br />

<pre>
original 
<img src="sample.png" height="200"> <br />

         K=2                      K=3                        K=4 
<img src="combined.png" height="200">
</pre>

With some clever logic and modification, it may be possible to only isolate the pixels on the image that are powder.
